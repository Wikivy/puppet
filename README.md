# Wikivy's Puppet Configuration

Wikivy is a wiki farm, that provides free MediaWiki hosting. Wikivy is powered by volunteers only, and we believe our code should be open source.

This repository contains our production Puppet configuration.

# Security Vulnerabilities

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any part of our code, please do not post it publicly by using our wikis or bug trackers for that; rather, please read our [security page](https://meta.wikivy.com/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Security) carefully, and follow the instructions.

As a quick overview, you can email security concerns to security@wikivy.com, or if you'd like, you can instead directly create a security-related task here, but please leave the "Security" project on the issue.
